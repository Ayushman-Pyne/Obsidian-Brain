 Ohk So all the things B tech will be in a separate vault and i plan on keeping a journal for classes and make the most out of it ðŸ˜…

 
 Hopefully It leads to me learning something not taught in courses online. Yes it's a college and I will prolly update my LinkedIn profile a little into the semester.

 All other courses related stuff will be updated here.


I will probably link the vault GitHub also when i update my Linkedln.
