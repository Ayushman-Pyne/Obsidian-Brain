4. Procedural Bureaucracy: The bureaucratic procedures inherent in some commercial banking processes may result in delays or inconveniences for customers during transactions or service access.

## KYC

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a vital protocol employed by commercial banks and financial institutions to confirm client identities and evaluate their appropriateness, adhering to regulatory and anti-money laundering (AML) criteria. KYC procedures are essential for managing the threats of financial misconduct, upholding the soundness of the financial framework, and safeguarding against illicit practices like money laundering, terrorist funding, and fraudulent activities. 

### Core components of KYC

1. Customer Identification: Banks are required to establish the identity of their customers by collecting official documents such as government-issued IDs, passports, or driver's licenses. These documents help verify the customer's name, address, date of birth, and other pertinent information.
   
2. Risk Assessment: Banks are responsible for evaluating the risks associated with serving a particular customer. Factors such as the customer's background, source of funds, business activities, and the level of risk associated with the customer's profile are considered in this assessment.
   
3. Customer Due Diligence (CDD): This involves gathering sufficient information to understand the nature of the customer's activities, the purpose of the account, and the anticipated transaction patterns. Enhanced due diligence may be necessary for higher-risk customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and complex transactions.
   
4. Ongoing Monitoring: Once the customer has been fully onboarded, banks are required to monitor the customer's transactions and activities. Any deviations or suspicious activities are thoroughly investigated, and additional information may be sought from the customer.

5. Record-Keeping: Banks are required to maintain accurate records of customer identification details, account opening information, and transaction records for a specified period in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The KYC process is not only important for meeting regulatory obligations but also serves to build and maintain trust, safeguard the financial institution's reputation, and protect the interests of legitimate customers. Additionally, it helps in promoting transparency, integrity, and security within the banking sector.

### Utilities of KYC

1. Risk Mitigation: KYC helps banks assess and mitigate potential financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud.

2. Regulatory Compliance: It ensures adherence to laws and regulations aimed at combating financial crimes, promoting trust, and maintaining the integrity of the financial system.

3. Customer Protection: KYC safeguards customers' identities and financial transactions, reducing the risk of identity theft and unauthorized account access.

4. Fraud Prevention: It assists in identifying and preventing fraudulent behaviour by monitoring customer accounts and conducting ongoing due diligence.

5. Enhanced Due Diligence: For high-risk customers, KYC enables banks to gather additional information and implement stricter monitoring measures.
6. Operational Efficiency: Despite initial resource and time requirements, KYC enhances operational efficiency, facilitating smoother account opening, transactions, and compliance management.

7. Trust and Reputation: By demonstrating a commitment to integrity and compliance, robust KYC processes help banks maintain trust, credibility, and a positive reputation with stakeholders.

It might fail to deeply investigate the underlying causes of weaknesses or the intricate aspects of external threats, potentially missing crucial insights.

2. Influence of Personal Bias: Due to its subjective nature, SWOT analysis is susceptible to biases and personal viewpoints, impacting the trustworthiness of the conclusions drawn. Varied interpretations of the same factors among individuals in the organization can lead to inconsistencies in the analysis.

Rapid changes in the market, industry trends, or internal processes can quickly make the analysis outdated, necessitating regular reviews and updates.

## Conclusion

In summary, while SWOT analysis provides a useful structure for organizations to evaluate internal strengths and weaknesses, along with external opportunities and threats, it's important to acknowledge the limitations related to oversimplification, subjectivity, static perspective, prioritization gaps, restricted creativity, and insufficient environmental scrutiny that can accompany this method. By staying aware of these constraints and integrating SWOT analysis with complementary strategic methodologies, organizations can nurture a more comprehensive and insightful strategy formulation and decision-making process.
