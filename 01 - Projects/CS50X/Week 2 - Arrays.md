#### 1. Scrabble
This was a very straight forward problem, that takes two string inputs and calculate score based on the following table and display the winner,

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |
