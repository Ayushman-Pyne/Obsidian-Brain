# Week 0 - Scratch

The first video starts off as an introduction to computational thinking, i.e. thinking in algorithms. 
The class then continues to explain the unary operator using fingers. For example if the 1st finger of the hand is ☝🏻 then it stands for one and for 2 fingers ✌🏻 it's two. here the order is not prioritized. Just to represent a number N, a symbol representing one is repeated N times. This represents the base system of one.

Base represents the number of different digits used to represent a number. Here Base is 1 because one is only repeated and no other digit is used. 

But that only leads us to get up to 5 in one hand, 10 if both hands are used, 20 if u count your toes too. But what if we need to count higher than that we would need more fingers. This is where more base numbers come in play. As for computers, they use a base system of 0s and 1s. And the order is given priority. 0 represents OFF, 1 represents ON. These are basically on and off states of a transistor in the computer CPU. A computer CPU consists of millions of transistors.

A binary digit in the computer is also called a Bit. 1 bit represents only 2 states ON and OFF.

The System we use to represent numbers is the decimal system. It has a base of 10, i.e. it has 10 base digits that are used to represent all the numbers. by using their position.

Similarly the binary digits can be used to represent numbers or data in general.

A one in the 4th place from the left would represent 8.

A byte consists of 8 bits.

To represent the symbols that represent letters and convey them to the computer a byte follows a specific set of rules called the ASCII to interpret for the computer.

The above table represents the ASCII equivalent to represent letters. For Example: 65 in binary would be interpreted by the computer as the letter **'A'** or 01000001 will be **'A'**. 
Only points to remember from the table are number of A-Z and a-z.

Unicode is another way to represent the same. Unicode usually is 32 bits.

#### U+1F602 is used to represent the 😂 face in Unicode.

Another interesting thing about unicode is the combining of emojis or different elements of an emoji. For example: There is this 👍 emoji and this 👍🏻 emoji, they both represent thumbs up but are different in skin color. To represent them in unicode there were two ways. The first being to assign a different value for both the emojis, but that would create problems when there are more than one hand sign and 5 skin tones. The problem being that
