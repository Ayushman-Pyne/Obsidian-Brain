# Week 0 - Scratch

The first video starts off as an introduction to computational thinking, i.e. thinking in algorithms. 
The class then continues to explain the unary operator using fingers. For example if the 1st finger of the hand is ☝🏻 then it stands for one and for 2 fingers ✌🏻 it's two. here the order is not prioritized. Just to represent a number N, a symbol representing one is repeated N times. This represents the base system of one.

Base represents the number of different digits used to represent a number. Here Base is 1 because one is only repeated and no other digit is used. 

But that only leads us to get 5 numbers in one hand.
