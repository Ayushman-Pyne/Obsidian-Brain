## INPUT AND OUTPUT

#### 7. WAP to input the radius of a circle and find its area and perimeter. 
- Note: 
	- Area of a circle=22/7\* $radius^2$
	- Circumference of a circle= 2 * 22/7 * radius

#### 14. WAP to input a floating point number and round it off to two places of decimal. 
- For Example: 
	- INPUT: Enter a floating point number: 12.367 
	- OUTPUT: Rounded off to two places of decimal:12.37 
	- INPUT: Enter a floating point number: 14.563 
	- OUTPUT: Rounded off to two places of decimal:14.56

#### 15. WAP to input two integers (say a and b) and interchange their values and display the result.(using third variable)
- For Example: 
	- INPUT: Enter two integers: 15 36 
	- OUTPUT: Before interchange: a=15 and b=36 after interchange: a=36 and b=15 
	- Please note that you can take just one variable other than a and b for interchanging.
