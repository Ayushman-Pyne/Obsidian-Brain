# 02 - WAP to perform arithmetic operations (and Average) between two variables (Explicitly put the value)

## Algorithm

```Algorithm
Step 1: 
Step 2:

```

## Program

```Python
a = 2

b = 3

  

print(a, " + ", b, " = ", a+b)

print(a, " - ", b, " = ", a-b)

print(a, " * ", b, " = ", a*b)

if b != 0:

    if a>=b:

        print(a, " / ", b, " = ", a/b)

    else:

        print(b, " / ", a, " = ", b/a)

if b != 0:

    if a>=b:

        print(a, " % ", b, " = ", a%b)

    else:

        print(b, " % ", a, " = ", b%a)

print("Average = ", (a+b)/2)
```
