## Ohk so I should introduce myself

So as of now the date and time is 2024-05-10 23:53 in IST. 
I have completed the week 0 of CS50X 2024 and it's really interesting. As I progress in the journey of basically me learning Computer Science. I'll keep storing the notes and the homework i do and keep linking them here. All the courses that I watch online, any course on Computer Science I attend offline. If the notes are important to me I'll keep storing them here.

This will continue until I gain a Job that I like or I finally understand enough to make my own companyü§ûüèª. Basically make a living out of this passion of computers I have.

## About The Vault

- I saw this video of [CyanVoxel](https://www.youtube.com/@cyanvoxel) where he showcased his setup and the organization made sense to me. So I'll use it here. In the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAkerV8rlow), he uses a mixture of 
	- Zettelkasten folders 
		- Fleeting (random thought notes and are meant to be more surface level)
		- Permanent (Refined notes that will be what u want to be reading)
		- Resources (Notes not by me but helpful in shortening the note taking the journey)
	- PARA folders
		- Projects (Short term deadlines that have a definite end date)
		- Areas (Wider scope that can keep on going, basically ideas i would have while learning)
		- Resources (just like the Zettelkasten folder is used to keep more over thoughts and surface level stuff pertaining to me or the things i am doing at the time only)
		- Archives (Completed Projects or areas that i have completed working on.)


### Some Ground Rules
- This is a Obsidian Vault so use obsidian to navigate... It'll be less painful.
	Here's the Obsidian page link if you don't have it installed on your computer.	[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- I really don't think anyone would need to fork this and try to make it better because there'll be a lot of notes in this and sorting them would be time consuming and inefficient.
- This is a Joker's approach to learning basically. It's all linked and u just have to complete a file before going to the next file. I as a layman can understand then u can too.
