## Ohk so I should introduce myself 
# I am Ayushman Pyne. 
## But anyone who visits this repo will refer to me as <span style = "color:Chartreuse">Arceus.</span>

So as of now the date and time is 2024-05-10 23:53 in IST. 
I have completed the week 0 of CS50X 2024 and it's really interesting. As I progress in the journey of basically me learning Computer Science. I'll keep storing the notes and the homework i do and keep linking them here. All the courses that I watch online, any course on Computer Science I attend offline. If the notes are important to me I'll keep storing them here.

This will continue until I gain a Job that I like or I finally understand enough to make my own company🤞🏻. Basically make a living out of this passion of computers I have.

## About The Vault
- Everything starts from the [[0 - Home]]Page.
>[!tip] [[0 - Home|Go to HOMEPAGE for detailed index]]

- I saw this video of [CyanVoxel](https://www.youtube.com/@cyanvoxel) where he showcased his setup and the organization made sense to me. So I'll use it here. In the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAkerV8rlow), he uses a mixture of 
	- Zettelkasten folders 
		- Fleeting (random thought notes and are meant to be more surface level)
		- Permanent (Refined notes that will be what u want to be reading)
		- Resources (Notes not by me but helpful in shortening the note taking the journey)
	- PARA folders
		- Projects (Short term deadlines that have a definite end date)
		- Areas (Wider scope that can keep on going, basically ideas i would have while learning)
		- Resources (just like the Zettelkasten folder is used to keep more over thoughts and surface level stuff pertaining to me or the things i am doing at the time only)
		- Archives (Completed Projects or areas that i have completed working on.)
- There'll also be a large deal of books and Movie Reviews kinda...


### Some Ground Rules
- This is a Obsidian Vault so use obsidian to navigate... It'll be less painful.
	Here's the Obsidian page link if you don't have it installed on your computer.	[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- I really don't think anyone would need to fork this and try to make it better because there'll be a lot of notes in this and sorting them would be time consuming and inefficient.
- Don't change the Theme to any other. If you prefer Light mode... well... you do you... the default light mode theme looks pretty good too. But it's my strong recommendation, that you use the dark amoled mode.
- This is a Joker's approach to learning basically. It's all linked and u just have to complete a file before going to the next file. I as a layman can understand then u can too.
