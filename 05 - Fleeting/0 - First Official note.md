So as of now the date and time is 2024-05-10 23:53 in IST. 
I have completed the week 0 of CS50X 2024 and it's really interesting. As I progress in the journey of basically me learning Computer Science. I'll keep storing the notes and the homework i do and keep linking them here. All the courses that I watch online, any course on Computer Science I attend offline. If the notes are important to me I'll keep storing them here.

This will continue until I gain a Job that I like or I finally understand enough to make my own companyü§ûüèª. Basically make a living out of this passion of computers I have.

### Some Ground Rules
- This is a Obsidian Vault so use obsidian to navigate... It'll be less painful.
	Here's the Obsidian page link if you don't have it installed on your computer.	[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- I really don't think anyone would need to fork this and try to make it better because there'll be a lot of notes in this and sorting them would be time consuming and inefficient.
- This is a Joker's approach to learning basically.
